## Assignment

1. Load "external" data in a browser-based text experiment. You may use the p5 [loadJSON()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadJSON) function featured in many of the video tutorials, but this is also an opportunity to explore the JavaScript [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) with `await` and `async` as [found in these examples](https://editor.p5js.org/a2zitp/collections/cgfJWhpsE). See above for relevant video tutorials. Here are some ideas:

   - Look through [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) and download JSON files for use in a p5.js sketch. For this I suggest using `loadJSON()` directly.
   - Use [RiTa.js](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS) or [Compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) to analyze and/or modify text.
   - Use an API like [Datamuse](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) or [Wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/) to lookup meta-data about a word.
   - Try using another API from the examples (NYTimes, Wikipedia, etc.) or pick your own not from the examples!

2. Document your experience working with the library, API, or data source in a blog post and consider the following questions (stemming from the [Excavating AI](https://www.excavating.ai/) reading.
   - What is the origin of the data?
   - Who had the power to collect, label, and make available the data?
   - If you had to create a "data biography" (Thank you to Ellen Nickles for this term), what would you include? Have the maintainers of this dataset or API made this information easily available?
   - What potential harms could result from the collection, use (or misue) of the data?
