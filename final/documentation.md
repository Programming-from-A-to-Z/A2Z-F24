## Guidelines

Final project presentations are December 4th, during regular class time. Presentations will be approximately 8 minutes each, I keep time to keep everything on schedule.

Please post your final project documentation to a web page (blog post is fine) and pull request a link next to your name on the above. This is due Friday, December 13th (spooky!).

Final Project presentations can be demonstrations and do not require a slide deck, however, you might find slides useful to help you plan and structure your demo and discussion. It's up to you to figure out how to best document your project, here are some loose guidelines if you aren't sure what to include.

- Title
- Sketch link
- One sentence description
- Project summary (250-500 words)
- Inspiration: How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills, etc.
- Process: How did you make this? What did you struggle with? What were you able to implement easily and what was difficult?
- Audience/Context: Who is this for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?
- Code references: What examples, tutorials, references did you use to create the project? (You should cite the source of any code you use in code comments with the exception of examples specifically provided by me for the class.)
- Next steps: If you had more time to work on this, what would you do next?
