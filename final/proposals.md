## Proposal Feedback TLDR:

1. Is the idea clear? Is there a clearly stated goal? What do you understand / not understand?
2. What about scope? Can it be done in such a short period of time under current circumstances?
3. Suggestions for relevant tutorials, reference projects, or other resources?
4. What is a strategy for "play testing" in class on Nov 27?

## Proposal Guidelines

After reviewing the [Final Project Overview](README.md), create a final project proposal. It's up to you to best present your idea, but some things I would suggest are:

- **Collect inspirations**: How did you become interested in this idea? quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills.
- **Collect source material**: drawings, images, videos, sounds, text
- **Collect code**: your own sketches and/or other people's sketches.
- **Collect ideas for title**
- **Collect ideas for 1-sentence description?**
- **Context?** Who's it for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?
- **Collect questions for your classmates.**
  - What are you unsure of? Conceptually and technically.

## Presenter tips and guidelines

1. Give a clear and specific statement of what you’re trying to achieve. State the minimal amount of information: Where ideally would this project be experienced and who is your audience? (Be specific! Avoid "everyone" or "anyone" at the audience.)
2. You don't need to analyze or interpret your work, try presenting a factual account of what you intend to build.
3. Are there technical hurdles that you don't know how to approach? Ask! We can use the time to discuss your proposal with tips on how to get started.
4. What do you want to get out of the feedback? Prepare questions that get at specific aspects of your project you’re unsure of.

### What constitutes a clearly stated goal?

1. What is the project about?
2. What is it?
3. What is the context in which it will be experienced? Where, how and when?
4. Who is the participant or audience?
5. What is this project asking them to do?
6. What is the duration of the experience?
7. What do you want them to take away from the project?

## Feedback tips and guidelines

Your job is to help the creator(s) of the project meet their goals. Can you separate your personal taste and world view from your feedback?

### Understanding the Proposal

1. Do you understand the project?
2. Do you understand the specific goals?
3. Is the project realistic in scope?
4. What will be some stumbling blocks for the project to meet its goals?
5. Does the project offer something new?
6. What does this remind you of?
7. What stood out to you?

### Analyze the Proposal

1. Are there frameworks that precede this particular work? For instance: At a carnival, it might be hard (but interesting) to stage a funeral; on a busy pedestrian intersection, a quiet project that requires time to even notice it might be missed.
2. Are the technology, context, and intention working together or at odds?
3. Are there cultural factors that could lead to understanding/misunderstanding?
4. Are there biases on the part of the maker or viewer that are factors in receiving / interpreting the work?
