# Final Projects

Your final project is a three-ish week assignment to be completed in two stages (proposal and implementation). Proposals will be presented in class on Nov 13 and Nov 20 - [proposal presentation schedule and guidelines](proposals.md)! Final presentations will be Dec 4 - [final presentation schedule and guidelines](documentation.md)

The final project should be a creative project that builds off or is inspired by the concepts we've covered this semester. You should feel free to think non-traditionally, projects do not need to be screen-based and there is no requirement to use a particular aspect of JavaScript or programming.

Final projects can be collaborations with anyone in any class. Final projects can be one part of a larger project integrated with a different class.

Other notes:

1. Keeping things simple and small in scope is a plus. If your project idea is a big one, consider documenting the larger idea but implementing just a small piece of it.
2. Also think about making a final project for a small audience, even one single person like a family member or friend. . . or yourself. This can be a good way to focus your idea and design process. "Generalizing" the idea can come later (or maybe not at all.)

## Project Development and Testing

Testing will follow a "speed round robin" format. The class will be divided into two groups and there will be two rounds. In each round, half the students will set up their projects on laptops in the classroom, while the other half will engage with the projects by viewing, interacting with, or listening to for about 5â€“7 minutes. Then each tester will rotate to the next project.

What testing means will almost certainly vary depending on the type of project. For an interactive web application, providing a link to a rough prototype is ideal. For a physical installation or performance, you may need to think creatively. One key "rule" you should attempt try to follow is this: no explaining the project until after the person has viewed or interacted with it.

If you're unsure how to design your testing process, feel free to email me, and I can help!
